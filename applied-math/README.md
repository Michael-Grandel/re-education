# Overview
My primary goal here is to understand the mathematics of everything I learned. That pretty much means deriving everything. My favorite courses were definitely Numerical methods, which ties in all the advanced math with comp-sci.

# Courses

# Other folder
This folder features things that aren't related to my coursework, but derivations or concepts that came up through friendly discussion or out of curiousity.

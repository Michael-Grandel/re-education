# Overview
My primary goal here is to understand the mathematics of everything I learned. That pretty much means deriving everything. My favorite courses were definitely Numerical methods, which ties in all the advanced math with comp-sci.

# Courses

- APMA  E2000: Multivariate Calc
- MATH UN2010: Linear Algebra
- MATH UN2030: ODEs
- APMA  E3102: PDEs
- APMA  E4101: Dynamical Systems
- APMA  E4300: Numerical Methods I
- APMA  E4301: Numerical Methods II

# Other folder
This folder features things that aren't related to my coursework, but derivations or concepts that came up through friendly discussion or out of curiousity.

## Notes
At first I was using handwritten notes and typing up the math using latex, and programming the images. That is fun and all, but there are two issues:

1. Takes too long 
    - Interferes with goal of review at a good pace
2. There is something about writing by hand that helps with memory 
    - Interferes with goal of re-learning the math

So, I will upload my hand-written notes as a priority, and when the mood strikes, I will type up the math via latex and graphs.

# Re-Education
A collection of notes, mathematical derivations, and re-learning of subjects studied during my undergrad at Columbia University. This also contains notes about research papers and up-to-date science.

## Motivation
As a first-gen college student and American, I had to figure out what life looks like after high-school all on my own, without any legacy to guide me. A benefit of this is I get to explore and pursue my own interests without familial pressure to become anything but financially secure. While I found myself deeply passionate about math, I found there were too many of it's applications that interest me, and I struggle to hone-in on one. This led me to pursue my undegrad experience at Columbia Univeristy (SEAS) by completing a triple minor, as well as replacing all undergraduate coursework with advanced graduate versions when permitted. I studied:

1. Computer Science: Intelligent Systems (major)
2. Applied Math
3. Applied Physics
4. Financial Engineering

After completing fundemental coursework in each discpline, I was in a unique position where I saw the beauty of their intersectionality, and I was able to complete advanced coursework with ease. For example, majoring in computer science allowed me to easily complete all the logic and coding problems in the other disciplines, such as Numerical Methods, Simulation, or Advanced Physics lab. Similarly, having a deep understanding in applied math, allowed me to tune and investigate Machine Learning models, code Ray-Tracing in computer graphics, and solve quantum physics equations. In the end, skills in each course were easily translatable.

The problem came after graduation. While I deeply wanted to continue my studies, I had to be pragmatic and get a job with my computer science degree and become a Software Engineer. This was a journey in of itself, but I quickly realized Software Engineering is completely different from the advanced problems I was used to solving in my courses. There was no math to do in computer graphics, there were no complex systems or algorithms like in operating systems, and there was no innovation in AI technologies at an algorithmic level. I dove deep into software engineering and now after 4 years, I see the skills it has taught me - skills never taught in school. But, as each year progressed, my anxiety over the forgotten math built.

Furthermore, with a lack of direction, I threw myself in so many hobbies and interests in life, while freezing in indecision about others. I became a music producer and released music on labels. I played D1/D2 level adult volleyball in national leagues and at the upcoming Gay Games in Valencia 2026. I traveled to so many places and lived in many states, exploring cultures and pros and cons of it all. I became a qualified pro League of Legends player (reached Masters+ ranks). The interesting thing to note is my mathematical and analytical thinking was still alive in all of them. For example, I discovered through my music interests how sound, music technology, and Fast Fourier Transforms, and music psychology all work together.

But now, after 4 years of experiencing so much, I am ready to start collecting all my knowledge together, and pivoting back into the insersection of math, comp sci, physics, and operations research.

### Graduate School
This is one of the biggest motivations for starting this repo. So, why not a masters to re-learn my math knowledge? 

Well, the unfortunate thing about having done graduate coursework in my undergrad, I already technically completed a master. [If you look at NYU's masters of science in Scientific Computing bulletin, ](https://bulletins.nyu.edu/graduate/arts-science/programs/scientific-computing-ms/#curriculumtext) I already completed all the coursework, if not more. I've even done research and projects as well, but we can be fair and say the only thing I haven't completed a thesis or a capstone project. 

So, why would I pay $60k+ per year for knowledge I already have, and just to complete a project? It's unfortunate that I don't 'legally' have a degree to showcase my knowledge besides my undergraduate transcript. But, at the end of the day, what really matters to me is the knowledge itself. So, instead I am going to review all my notes and material from undegraduate to refersh my memory, and make my own fun project integrating my knowledge. 

Why not a PhD? Well, let's remember how I am a first-gen american, figuring out his way in the world. I didn't really know what a PhD entails, but in 2023 I gathered the volition to finally look into one. When I did, I saw deadlines are coming up in 2 weeks. So, I did my best to gather recomendation letters and apply in 2 weeks. As you can imagine, the quality of my application was poor and I got declined. This process though showed me further how unfortunate COVID has been.

A PhD was always something I wanted to do, as I love to teach at a college level, and also research sounds very appealing to me. After speaking with many friends pursuing a PhD, or those who completed PhDs in my work, I am well aware of common misconceptions of what a PhD and research are. Interestingly, my friends who know me all did say that I really do belong in a PhD program. But, one of the biggest things needed for an application are 3 rec letters. Due to COVID isolating my junior and senior year, there was nearly no opportunity to make research level connections. After all, junior and senior year is when these connections start to form.

Ultimately, a PhD is the route I will one day pursue, but thanks to a brilliant friend of mine, one idea is to volunteer at a lab, and that would be the start of my research journey. I will get knowledge of programs, make connections for rec letters and other opportunities, and get the ball rolling for a future integrated with research. 

### Apply for new jobs
Another option is to apply to jobs that are more at the intersction of what I want, such as quantum computing. Sadly, these jobs often require graduate credentials, and/or work experience in the field, which feels unfair in my context as explained previously. But, it is what it is. If the goal is to immerse myself in these sciences again, then I realized I can still do that on my own with the resources I already have. Starting with my notes, to participating in Kaggle competions or making my own little projects. I don't need someone to grant me the life I want, I can go and get it my own way, because deep down what I really want is an immersion in the mathematical beauty of this reality we live in.
